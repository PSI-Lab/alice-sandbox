# Predict in-vivo RNA Secondary Structure

## Introduction & Background

- RNA plays an important part in regulating gene expression,
 both as an intermediate molecule for coding genes,
 and as a direct regulator via noncoding genes and noncoding parts of coding genes.

- The regulatory function of noncoding RNAs (and noncoding parts of coding genes)
is enabled by RNA's versatility in adopting complex secondary and tertiary structures

- Existing RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms mainly focus on
finding the minimum free energy structure, or an ensemble of structures,
which is insufficient for predicting RNA folding in vivo,
due to the presence of RBPs, proteins, etc.

- Recent advance in combing chemical probing and high throughput sequencing
enabled the discovery of whole transcriptome RNA structure in multiple species and cell types

- Purpose of this work is to construct computational models for RNA secondary structure in multiple species/cell types
