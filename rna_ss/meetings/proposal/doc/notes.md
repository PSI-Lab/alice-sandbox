- focus on review
    - NN
    - experimental technique

emphasize in vivo
make use of in vitro data


- separate chapter:

    - modelling

transformer

model trans-factor, to generalize to unseen cell types or organisms

training on different dataset (combined), since different experiment (DMS, PARS, SHAPE) techniques provide complementary information

    - evaluation result

    - application:
        - mutation
        - RNA stability, post-transcriptional regulation

- discussion:
    - 3D structure, RNA-RNA interaction
