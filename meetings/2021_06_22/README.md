Last week:

- investigating performance gap between training & testing of S2 scoring model

- hypothesis: gap is due to the construction of pairs for siamese training,
where the target structure is out of topk in most cases

- above hypothesis is not fully validated yet, conflicting lines of evidence


## S2 scoring network investigation

- check performance on a subset of training examples (as opposed to using test set)







- print prediction while training
