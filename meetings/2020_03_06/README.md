## RNA-SS pytorch

Re-implement RNA SS model training in pytorch, minimal prototype working
(stacked 2D map, dynamic length padding per batch, (non-masked) 2D convolution, masked loss function).
Pending implementation of performance metric + residual + masked conv (optional, not needed if just want to reproduce SPOT-RNA).

## New data

https://www.broadinstitute.org/connectivity-map-cmap
To date, CMap has generated a library containing over 1.5M gene expression profiles from ~5,000 small-molecule compounds, and ~3,000 genetic reagents, tested in multiple cell types.

gene expression (processed?) used in paper "Gene expression inference with deep learning", can email authors, see https://github.com/uci-cbcl/D-GEX
