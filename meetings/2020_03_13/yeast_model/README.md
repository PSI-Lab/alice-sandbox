## Whether indirect training successfully learned direct information

For context, see https://github.com/PSI-Lab/alice-sandbox/blob/380a260c4b8c39be9ab644804b170733869607fb/meetings/2020_03_06/yeast_model/README.md#multi-task-learning-without-providing-single-fitness








## Carry-over from last week


TODO result

TODO check whether this indirect training can also reconstruct single KO fitness (will be interesting if it does)

TODO set up hyperparam tuning

TODO match D-cell paper NN structure and performance (add residual connection if go deeper?)

TODO how can one gene generalize to another?

TODO how can gene pair A, B generalize to gene pair C, D?

- understand why gene interaction is more difficult (& important) than fitness

- hyperparam tuning to match their performance

- multitask: predict fitness and interaction?

- incorporate other prior information to improve performance


- read cell map paper, make sure we understand how gene interaction were calculated,
and why it is more important than fitness


- dataset target value distribution, correlation between reps

- try prediction fitness of single gene KO

- KO v.s. KD, different alleles


TODO is 0/1 encoding the best? try 1/-1??
